The standardization of image classification tasks like the [ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/) [2] has resulted in a reliable way to compare top performing architectures.\\\\\\\\n This Docker container contains the tools to train an image classifier on your personal dataset. It is a highly customizable tool  that let's you choose between tens of different [top performing architectures](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-applications) and training parameters.\\\\\\\\n The container also comes with a pretrained general-purpose image classifier trained on ImageNet.\\\\\\\\n The PREDICT method expects an RGB image as input (or the url of an RGB image) and will return a JSON with the top 5 predictions.\\\\\\\\n <img class='fit', src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deephdc/DEEP-OC-image-classification-tf/master/images/imagenet.png'/>\\\\\\\\n **References**\\\\\\\\n [1]: Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio, and Geofrey Hinton.
